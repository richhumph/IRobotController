# IRobotController
Warehouse/robot controller scenario

Requires .Net 4.6.1
IoC using Ninject
Unit Tests using NUnit & RhinoMocks
Layered design
Generics
LINQ


Specification

A large distribution company have just received a squad of prototype picking robots, which can be
used to pick a given order from the stock within the warehouse by giving them a set of instructions.
The company want to create a proof of concept that initially just shows that the robot can be
navigated around an empty warehouse given a set of instructions. Navigating around objects,
collisions, and actually picking the stock are out of scope for the initial development phase, you
should just concentrate on moving the robots around the empty warehouse.
A robots position and direction can be represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a
letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The warehouse is divided up into a grid to
simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the robot is in the bottom left
corner of the warehouse and facing North.
In order to control a robot, the application needs to send a simple string of characters. 

<, > make the robot spin 90 degrees left or right respectively,
without moving from its current location.
Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).
^ means move forward one grid point, while maintaining the same direction.
Input

The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the warehouse grid, the lower-left coordinates
are assumed to be 0, 0.
The rest of the input is information pertaining to the robots that have been deployed. Each robot has
two lines of input. The first line gives the robot’s position, and the second line is a series of
instructions telling the robot how to navigate the warehouse.
The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and
y co-ordinates and the robot’s orientation.
Each robots movement will be finished sequentially, which means that the second robot won&#39;t start to
move until the first one has finished moving. Collisions between robots are out of scope and do not
need to be considered.
Output
The output for each robot should be its final co-ordinates and heading.
